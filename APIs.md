# Flight Traffic & Routes APIs
[Skyscanner](https://rapidapi.com/DataCrawler/api/skyscanner50/) with RapidAPI
* Python requests supported
* Can search for flights from origin > destination with price

[Flight Radar](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/flight-radar1/)
* Search flights via flight code
* Not sure if saves historical flights (?)
* Good for current flight status but maybe not for historical purposes

[OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/faq)
* Open source but not very reliable
* [Free database](https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights/tree/master/data)
